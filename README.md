# hello-world

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

Well, I got better. We found them. Camelot! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

I dunno. Must be a king. Well, we did do the nose. It's only a model. A newt? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
She looks like one.
Oh, ow!

Who's that then? Camelot! What a strange person. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Camelot!

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
You don't vote for kings.
I'm not a witch.
What a strange person. I am your king. We want a shrubbery!! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, she turned me into a newt.

Camelot! How do you know she is a witch? Burn her anyway! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

Camelot! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Did you dress her up like this? Shut up! Will you shut up?!

Why? The nose? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

What do you mean? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! I am your king. He hasn't got shit all over him. Bring her forward!

I have to push the pram a lot. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

I'm not a witch. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

Who's that then? Bring her forward! Now, look here, my good man. What do you mean? I am your king.

I dunno. Must be a king. Look, my liege! Oh, ow! I have to push the pram a lot.

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Bloody Peasant! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

Now, look here, my good man. I have to push the pram a lot. Well, how'd you become king, then? Bloody Peasant! Why? The nose?
